# SQL Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project1

## Overview

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about layoffs in 2022. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).

## Dataset

The dataset includes various details about layoffs such as company name, industry, location, number of employees laid off, and more. It provides a valuable resource for analyzing trends and patterns in layoffs during 2022.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis Project.sql`: Main SQL file for data cleaning and EDA.
- `Starting File/`: Directory containing additional SQL scripts used in the project.

## Setup

To run the SQL scripts, you need to have a MySQL server set up. Follow these steps:

1. **Install MySQL**:
   - Download and install MySQL from the official [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/).

2. **Load the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022).
   - Load the dataset into your MySQL database.

3. **Run SQL Scripts**:
   - Use a MySQL client (such as MySQL Workbench) to execute the provided SQL scripts.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process includes:
- Removing duplicates.
- Handling missing values.
- Standardizing date formats.
- Correcting data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis involves:
- Summary statistics.
- Data visualizations.
- Identifying trends and patterns in layoffs.
- Analyzing layoffs by industry, location, and other factors.

## Results

The findings from the data cleaning and exploratory data analysis are documented in the SQL scripts and can be used to derive insights about the layoffs in 2022.
